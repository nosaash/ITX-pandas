# ITX-pandas
Igor ITX to pandas

This is a simple set of commands/boiler plates that I use for plotting data from transport measurement. 
- `helvetica.py` I use Helvetica instead of the Deju Vu Sans, Arial, etc whenever it is possible. Matplotlib has missing font info bug being there for a while. 
- `boilerplate.py`	boilerplate with some device info. 
- `boilerplate_matplotlib.py`	boilerplate for just plotting in matplotlib. 
- `itx_to_pandas_df.py` This is the file for the main functions.
